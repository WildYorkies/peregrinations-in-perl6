# Peregrinations in Perl6 for the Perpetual Pupil

## Audience

I assume that the reader has programmed before, but maybe you've never written and shared
your own modules/library before. You've probably written some Python scripts, but you've
never written a web app before.

If the reader has packaged and shared their code or written a web app, they will still benefit
from learning about the Perl 6 world via this book.

If you've never programmed before, try starting with Think Perl 6. Then come back.

## Goal

The goal of this book is to get the reader acquainted with Perl 6 and _also it's ecosystem_.

We will briefly cover some interesting things in the language, but the "learning Perl 6" goal is
mostly going to be met by reading and writing code, not by reading _about_ reading and writing code.

After seeing the language, you'll learning about how to make stuff, i.e. how to write modules and
share them with others.

Then for the grand finale I'll show the reader how to do web stuff using some new sort-of-standards
that I like that have cropped up as of late.

## Disclaimer

There are most certainly mistakes in the contents herein, and I'm sure there are many times where I am flat-out incorrect.

I merely hope that my enjoyment of Perl 6 comes through in my writing and that reading this won't be a huge waste of your time.
