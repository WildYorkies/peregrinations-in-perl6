# Walkthrough on writing a fully distributable module

## What we're going to do

We are going to write this [Random Quiz Generator](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter8/) from the amazingly great book _Automate The Boring Stuff with Python_!

So we're going to follow the steps outlined in that project, with one exception. We're going to
package all of our code up so that other teachers can download it and use what we've written!

So we're going to upload it to the P6 ecosystem for maximum visiblity and so it can be accessed via zef.

You should do all of the steps described here, with me.

## Setting Up The Directory for the Project

## Writing our Code

Here's our program checklist:

- Creates 35 different quizzes.

- Creates 50 multiple-choice questions for each quiz, in random order.

- Provides the correct answer and three random wrong answers for each question, in random order.

- Writes the quizzes to 35 text files.

- Writes the answer keys to 35 text files.

This means the code will need to do the following:

- Store the states and their capitals in a dictionary.

- Call open(), write(), and close() for the quiz and answer key text files.

- Use random.shuffle() to randomize the order of the questions and multiple-choice options.

### Initial Code

```perl6
sub make-quizzes(Int $quizzes, %data, Str $name) {
  for ^$quizzes -> $quiz {
    # Create the quiz and answer key files.
    my $quiz-file  = open("{$name}-{$quiz}.txt", :w);
    my $answer-key = open("{$name}-{$quiz}-answers.txt", :w);

    # Write out the header for the quiz.
    $quiz-file.print('Name:\n\nDate:\n\nPeriod:\n\n');
    $quiz-file.print((' ' x 20) ~ "$name (Form $quiz)");
    $quiz-file.print('\n\n');

    # Shuffle the order of the states.
    my @state = %data.keys;
    @state.=pick(*); # This should shuffle the list

    # Loop through all 50 states, making a question for each.
    for ^50 -> $state {
      # Get right and wrong answers.
      my $correct-answer = %data{@state[$state]};
      my @wrong-answer = %data.values;
      @wrong-answer[@wrong-answer.index($correct-answer)]:delete;
      @wrong-answer.=pick(3);
      my @answer-option = @wrong-answer.push: $correct-answer;
      @answer-option.=pick(*); # shuffles list?

      # Write the question and the answer options to the quiz file.
      $quiz-file.print("{$state}. {@state[$state]}?\n");
      $quiz-file.print("  {'ABCD'[$_]}. {@answer-option[$_]}\n") for ^4;
      $quiz-file.print('\n');

      # Write the answer key to a file.
      $answer-key.write("$state. {'ABCD'[@answer-option.index($correct-answer)]}\n");
    }
    $quiz-file.close;
    $answer-key.close;
  }
}

sub MAIN(Int :$num-quizzes, Str :$file) {
   my $fh = open($file, :r);
   my $quiz-name = $fh.get;
   say $quiz-name; 
   my @data = do for $fh.lines { $_.split(' - ').pairup };
   $fh.close;
   say @data.flat;

   # We'll use the test data above for now
   #make-quizzes($num-quizzes, @data, $quiz-name);
}
```
