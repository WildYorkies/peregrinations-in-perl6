# "I'm not going home. Not really."

My hope is that this is not goodbye, but instead hello.

If you've ever wanted to "get involved in the open source world", there
is no better way to start than to get involved with Perl6.

If you're an expert programmer, hack on the rakudo source code (it's basically written
in Perl6, afterall).

If you're a novice programmer, write modules, write code in Perl6, blog about your
experience.

If you're anyone at all, help beef up the docs.

If you don't know what you could do, just hang out in the IRC chat. The more the merrier.
