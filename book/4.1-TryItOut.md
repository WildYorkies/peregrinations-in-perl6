# Walkthrough on writing your own Web App

We will be using [Hiker](https://github.com/tony-o/perl6-hiker) to write our functioning soda machine. A machine
that takes quarters and gives a real soda back to the human!

The reason we are using Hiker is because it uses the HTTP::Server ecosystem that we've already discussed.

Starting at the "Boilerplate" heading of [this blog post](http://ugexe.com/hello-web-with-puree-perl-6/), I'll first ask that you go through the little tutorial found there.

When you've finished with that mini tutorial, come back and we'll code our soda machine.
